Problem Statement - Web app for elderly people
Project description:
Golden Agers is a web app designed to help elderly people using internet, our website helps the elderly people to connect with other elderly peoples nearby and also
call for volunteers can be made incase of any help needed, Our website features an SOS button that in case of any medical emergency connects the person to the 
Nearest health department.
Our website also shows the health reports of the person as health is the major concern for the elders at that age
Using our website volunteers can also signup for the events that will be conducted for the elderly people by the elderly people and community work for the same.
Our websites main features are - 
  
  1 Large icon (Increase readability)

Prototype 1:

  and Login page is also built but database has not been incorporated to it so anyone can login with any id or password
Only features and buttons can be seen as of now due to lack of database and news can be seen
